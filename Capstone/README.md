# Udacity Machine Learning Nano Degree Capstone Project: Stock Segmentation

## Software Requirement
To successfully execute the main iPython Notebook **Stock_Market_Segments.ipynb**, the following list of software and packages are needed:
1. Python 2.7
2. numpy 1.11.2
3. pandas 0.20.1
4. scikit-learn 0.17.1
5. matplotlib 1.5.1
6. scipy 0.18.1

## Data
The data for this project is stored in the file called **all_stock_data.csv**. The data was scraped from Yahoo Finance using the notebook **Stock_Data_Retrieval.ipynb**, which requires Python 3.5 to run (along with NASDAQ_LIST.csv and NYSE_LIST.csv). However, you don't need to run this notebook for this project. Just keep the **all_stock_data.csv** file in the same directory as the others.

## Setup
Just pull all the files from this repo into a directory and run the **Stock_Market_Segments.ipynb** in an environment that meets the software requirement.
